title: "EES 4891-06/5891-01: Bayesian Statistical Methods"
description: "An introduction to Bayesian statistics, with a focus on 
both practical application of Bayesian regression methods to data as 
well as philosophical background on statistical inference and 
interpretation of statistical analyses. Bayes's theorem and tools for 
applying it, including quadratic approximations, and 
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Advanced methods, including 
multilevel regression methods."

## Overview

The class will begin with an introduction to Bayesian statistics and 
then focus on practical application of regression methods to data. 
We will use R together with the 
[Stan software package](https://mc-stan.org) for Hamiltonian Monte Carlo 
methods. 
The course will combine practical applications of Bayesian methods to 
real (often messy) data with more philosophical discussions of Bayesian 
approaches to statistics and how to interpret results of statistical 
analyses. 
We will focus on regression methods, including hierarchical or 
multilevel regression modeling methods, which can be very powerful when 
you have data that has a nested structure (e.g., cities and counties 
within states or species within genera). 
Students will do projects applying Bayesian methods to their own data 
sets.

## Textbooks

We will use one required textbooks and two optional ones:

* {{% LONG_RETHINKING %}}

## Optional Books

* {{% LONG_DBDA %}} (online and print-reserve available at the Science 
  & Engineering Library)
* {{% LONG_WICKHAM %}} (there is a 
  [free e-book version]({{% WICKHAM_URL %}})
  available at <{{% WICKHAM_URL %}}>)
